# Active Handout Plugins

You can develop plugins using either React (with PropTypes and Styled-Components) or pure JS syntax.

## Setup

Run the following commands from the project's root directory:

    $ cd plugins
    $ npm install

## Developing plugins

Run the following command from the `plugins` directory:

    $ npm run dev

Now you can create and edit files in the `src` folder. These files will be compiled and exported to `content/js` automatically.
